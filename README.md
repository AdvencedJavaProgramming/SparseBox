# SparseBox

On-device backup restoration?
- manual mobilegestalt
- [x] rewrote SparseRestore to swift

## Installation
SideStore is recommended as you will also be getting the pairing file and setting up VPN.

Download ipa from Actions tab or [nightly.link](https://nightly.link/khanhduytran0/SparseBox/workflows/build/main/artifact.zip)

Before opening SparseBox, you have to close SideStore from app switcher. This is because only one app can use VPN proxy at a time. Maybe changing port could solve this issue.
